Options

  -d <directory> [<directory> ...]
    Recursively goes through the specified directories and deletes all files
    inside them using a defined overwrite algorithm.
    You can specify one or multiple directories.

  -f <file> [<file> ...]
    Irreversibly deletes the specified files using the same overwrite algorithm.

  -c <number>
    Sets the number of overwrite passes before deletion.
    The higher the number, the more secure the deletion and the less chance to recover.
    For example, "-c 3" means each file will be overwritten 3 times.

  -help
    Displays this help message.

Usage examples

  program -d /home/user/docs -c 5
    Deletes all files in the "/home/user/docs" folder with 5 overwrite passes.

  program -f secret.txt confidential.pdf -c 2
    Deletes the files "secret.txt" and "confidential.pdf" with 2 overwrite passes.

Recommendations

- Use the -c option to increase security; a value of at least 3 is recommended.
- Be careful selecting directories and files â€” recovery after using this utility is impossible.
